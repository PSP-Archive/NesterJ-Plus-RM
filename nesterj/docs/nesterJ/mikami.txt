Please send the bugs in:

	Reading Compressed File
	Sound Recording
	Screen shots

or so.

(But I will be able to understand you only in Japanese or
 in "easier" English.)
I might be able to fix the bugs ( or nothing to do --- ).


Added source files (All these are in "src/mikami")

	arc.cpp, arc.h :
			Archiver uncompression function and types.

	CSndRec.cpp, CSndRec.h :
			Wave sound recording class.



Changed source files:
	nes_rom.cpp :
			Some functions changed for read compressed file

	win32_emu.cpp :
		Some member functions added
			-> for sound recording.

	win32_directsound_sound_mgr.cpp :
		Added the member class (CSndRec rec) and some codes
			-> for sound recording.

	winmain.cpp :
		Added several codes
			->for menu command( Sound recording support ), and
			  for file open dialog ( Compressed file support ).

ver 0.17a :
	win32_emu.cpp :
		A member function added
			-> for sound recording.
	winmain.cpp :
		Added some codes
			-> for menu command( Sound recording bugs ).


ver 0.31 sp1 :
	for Developers:

	Be careful of
		void NES_PPU::render_bg member function.

	I added try-catch statement.

	When it caused error in for-loop
	and error-skip check box is checked,
	continue to loop.
	If error-skip check box is not checked,
	it throws an exception; It looks same to
	previous versions.

ver 0.351 sp4 :
	"mbcs.h" and "mbcs.cpp",which are added in ver 0.351 sp3, are removed.
	They have a seriouse problem on 1 byte "kata-kana" charactors,
	a part of Shift-JIS code.
	Instead, "mkutils.h" and "mkutils.cpp" are added.
	Their purpose is getting long file name, and creating several
	directories at once.
	They rooted WIN32-APIs.
	You follow GPL2 or lator.

ver 0.48
	add "shot_screen()" member function to these,
		win32_emu, screen_mgr, NES_screen_mgr, win32_NES_screen_mgr,
		win32_fullscreen_NES_screen_mgr, win32_windowed_NES_screen_mgr
	for Screen Shot.
	
	winmain.cpp changed for Menu for Screen Shot.
	CPathSettings and win32_dialogs changed for Screen Shot folder selecting.
	So was resource.
	
	voided debug.h, mono.h because these have memory error in debug.
