about Rec/Play Movie
-----------------------
  * movie file is normaly saved as 'movie\(ROM name).mov'.
    (you can change file name)

  * control start rec/play or stop in menu "FILE" - "Movie Rec/Play".

  * you can stop playing and replay the game at the part of movie.

  * not support some games that state save is incorrect (e.g. DiskSystem)
    since movie file include state save.
    and also you may not be able to use the old movie file if state file
    format is changed.


how to netplay in nesterJ
-----------------------------------


*****              OUT OF SUPPORT,               *****
***** DONT ASK ME QUESTION ABOUT NETWORK FEATURE *****


how to use netplay feature:

server:
  * load ROM
  * select "File"-"netplay"-"server (1P)"
  * input Network Latency ( 0(auto), 1(fast) - 9(slow))
    and Port number (1024-65535 except 8080, default:10000)

  then server starts waiting client connection.

  * if you wanna exit waiting client's connection,
    select "File"-"netplay"-"cancel connection"

client: (after server setup)

  * load same ROM
  * select "File"-"netplay"-"client (2P)"
  * input Server's IP Address (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) and Port number.


when connected, both server and client reset and start games.
server controls 1P, and client controls 2P.
but you must use 1P's pad of client machine to control 2P.
(because almost user seem to have only 1 pad. I too.)

while netplay, close button on the window title bar is grayed.
its enabled again when disconnected.
select "File"-"netplay"-"disconnect" to exit netplay.

when emulation is paused (beause of kill forcus, touch menu bar, ...),
connection between server and client must be broken.
if control seems to be freezed, please disconnect.

both server and client, usualy send only pad infomation,
so not supported games that use external devices.

  exception: MIC, VS-Unisystem's InsertCoin, HyperShot
             (nester sends these info as pad bits)

support FDS, but only server can change disk side.
and use shortcut key 'A' - 'E' to change it.(dont use menu)

save data must be same if exist.
if FDS, disk image (include written data) must be same.

GameGenie code is supported in netplay, but both must have same code.
Movie feature is not supported in netplay.


note:
support both LAN and Internet.

note2:
dont use CTRL+ALD+DEL to shutdown nester while netplay.
windows destroys only window, ghost task remains.
use "File"-"Netplay"-"disconnect" to exit netplay.

note3:
of course, need TCP/IP. :-)

  * drop frame doesnt occur if data server(client) sent is recieved

    (note: the time of 1 frame is 1/60 sec.)
