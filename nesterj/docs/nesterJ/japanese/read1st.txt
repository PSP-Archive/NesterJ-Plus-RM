"nesterJ" is based on "nester public beta 3" by Darren Ranalli.
It is translated into Japanese and added some functions.
It is also added many mappers written by Mr. Takeda.
Mr. Ranalli only knows these things; He does not know our details.
So you cannot ask him about "nesterJ".

We released English version.
You can get English verjon from;
