Exception Handler for Kernel 3.xx by sakya
__________________________________________

Hi! :)

First: this is not my code, I simply got the code from crazyc and SamuraiX and made it easy to use (at least for me). ;)
Original thread: http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9564
Maybe it's usefull for someone else...

What is this?
_____________
This is a prx to handle exception on PSP, when an exception is raised some usefull information are shown on the display (and can be dumped to a text file).

How to compile it
_________________
Enter the prx directory and simply type

	make

This way you have the exception.prx file.

How to use it
_____________
Check the test program in the test directory.
In your program you have only to include exception.h and initialize the handler.

	#include "../utility/exception.h"
	initExceptionHandler();

Copy exception.prx in the same directory where your EBOOT is.
